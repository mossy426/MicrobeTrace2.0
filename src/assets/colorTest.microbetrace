The community receives additional support through webinars, web-based resources, and customized follow-up support after the workshop.","Notes":null,"Federal Lever":null,"Combined Sub-agency Center/Office/Program and URL":"Citizens' Institute on Rural Design\n","Combined Resource  Name and URL":"Citizens; Institute on Rural Design (CIRD)\nhttps://www.arts.gov/initiatives/citizens-institute-on-rural-design ","Combined Sub-agency Center/Office/Program without URL":null,"Combined Resource  Name without URL":null,"":null,"nn":null,"directed":null},{"index":13,"source":"Few Environmental Hazards","target":"6.\nReliable Transportation","visible":true,"cluster":4,"origin":["Combined Data Tabl-Table 1.csv"],"hasDistance":false,"distance":0,"distanceOrigin":"","Subcategory":"Few Environmental Hazards","Vital Condition":"6.\nReliable Transportation","Executive Department Sub-agency Acronym":"NIST","Executive Department":"DOC","Sub-agency Center / Office / Program Name":"Materials and Structural Systems Division","Sub-agency Center / Office / Program Acronym":null,"Sub-agency Center / Office / Program URL":"https://www.nist.gov/el/materials-and-structural-systems-division-73100","Resource Name":"Community Resilience Program, Disaster and Failure Studies Program","Resource Acronym":null,"Resource URL":"https://www.nist.gov/resilience","Resource Description":"Guidance and tools to help communities improve the resilience of their buildings and infrastructure systems including planning for earthquakes, fires, and wind as well as the interface between  Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI).","Notes":"need to check center affiliation; edited description","Federal Lever":"Guidance ","Combined Sub-agency Center/Office/Program and URL":"Materials and Structural Systems Division\nhttps://www.nist.gov/el/materials-and-structural-systems-division-73100","Combined Resource  Name and URL":"Community Resilience Program, Disaster and Failure Studies Program\nhttps://www.nist.gov/resilience","Combined Sub-agency Center/Office/Program without URL":null,"Combined Resource  Name without URL":null,"":null,"nn":null,"directed":null},{"index":14,"source":"Active Transport","target":"6.\nReliable Transportation","visible":true,"cluster":4,"origin":["Combined Data Tabl-Table 1.csv"],"hasDistance":false,"distance":0,"distanceOrigin":"","Subcategory":"Active Transport","Vital Condition":"6.\nReliable Transportation","Executive Department Sub-agency Acronym":"CDC","Executive Department":"HHS","Sub-agency Center / Office / Program Name":"National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion","Sub-agency Center / Office / Program Acronym":"NCCDPHP","Sub-agency Center / Office / Program URL":"https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/index.htm","Resource Name":"Division of Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity","Resource Acronym":"DNPAO","Resource URL":"https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/community-strategies/index.htm","Resource Description":"Community Strategies to Increase Physical Activity","Notes":null,"Federal Lever":null,"Combined Sub-agency Center/Office/Program and URL":"National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP)\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/index.htm","Combined Resource  Name and URL":"Division of Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity (DNPAO)\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/community-strategies/index.htm","Combined Sub-agency Center/Office/Program without URL":null,"Combined Resource  Name without URL":null,"":null,"nn":null,"directed":null},{"index":15,"source":"Equitable Access to Information","target":"7.\nBelonging & Civic Muscle","visible":true,"cluster":1,"origin":["Combined Data Tabl-Table 1.csv"],"hasDistance":false,"distance":0,"distanceOrigin":"","Subcategory":"Equitable Access to Information","Vital Condition":"7.\nBelonging & Civic Muscle","Executive Department Sub-agency Acronym":"ACF","Executive Department":"HHS","Sub-agency Center / Office / Program Name":"Office of Regional Operations","Sub-agency Center / Office / Program Acronym":"ORO","Sub-agency Center / Office / Program URL":"https://www.acf.hhs.gov/oro","Resource Name":null,"Resource Acronym":null,"Resource URL":null,"Resource Description":"The Office of Regional Operations (ORO) guides the regional implementation of the Administration of Children and Families’ programs and high priority cross cutting initiatives to states, territories, tribes and grantees.

For Tiers 1-2, evidence should come from large, multisite studies with characteristics of the sample and setting1 similar to those in your school or district. Samples and settings can be pooled across multiple studies examining the same practice or program to meet the large, multisite sample criteria.

First, each state is allocated an amount equal to the amount that it received for fiscal year 1999. If the total program appropriation increases over the prior year, 85 percent of the remaining funds are allocated based on the number of children in the general population in the age range for which the states guarantee FAPE to children with disabilities. Fifteen percent of the remaining funds are allocated based on the number of children living in poverty that are in the age range for which the states guarantee FAPE to children with disabilities.\nMost of the federal funds provided to states must be passed on to LEAs. However, a portion of the funds may be used for state-level activities. Any funds not set aside by the state must be passed through to LEAs.

The award period for these projects is typically 5 years.\n\nParent training and information centers must serve parents of children of all ages (birth to 26) and all types of disabilities. Awards are made only to parent organizations as defined by IDEA. The training and information provided by the centers must meet the training and information needs of parents of children with disabilities living in areas served by the centers, particularly underserved parents and parents of children who may be inappropriately identified. At least one award for a parent training and information center must be made in each state, subject to the receipt of acceptable applications. Large and heavily populated states typically have multiple centers that serve designated counties. The parent centers also play an important role in dispute resolution by explaining to parents the benefits of alternative methods of dispute resolution, such as mediation, which states are required, by the IDEA, to make available. Parent center staff attend or facilitate over 1,000 alternative dispute resolution sessions every year. These alternative methods of dispute resolution can help avoid costly litigation. As part of that role, parent centers are required to meet with parents to explain the IDEA-mandated mediation process. In states where parent centers provide this service, they typically do so through contracts with State educational agencies.\n\nCommunity parent resource centers are parent training and information centers, operated by local parent organizations, that help ensure underserved parents of children with disabilities, including low-income parents, parents of children who are English learners, and parents with disabilities, have the training and information they need to enable them to participate effectively in helping their children. Community parent resource centers are required to establish cooperative partnerships with the parent training and information centers in their states.\n\nTechnical assistance is authorized to assist parent training and information centers, including community centers, in areas such as coordinating parent training efforts, disseminating scientifically based research and information, and the effective use of technology.

During National Preparedness Month, September 25, 2019, the agencies issued a companion guide, “The Role of Districts in Developing High-Quality School Emergency Operations Plans (District Guide). These documents align with and build upon years of school safety work to enhance planning and were the first joint product of these departments and agencies. The School Guide and the District Guide incorporate lessons learned from incidents and respond to the needs and concerns voiced by stakeholders following recent emergencies. All practitioners with school safety responsibilities (education officials, first responders, planners, elected leadership) are encouraged to use the School Guide and District Guide to collaborate as well as create or revise and update existing plans as well as align their emergency planning practices with those at the national, state, and local levels. \n\nThe guidance puts forth the key concepts and principles of school safety and preparedness planning as well as an overview of the recommended six- step planning process for developing and continually enhancing high-quality school emergency operations plans (EOPs). Planning teams can progress through and revisit each of the six steps. After a planning team is formed (Step 1: Form a Collaborative Planning Team), the team may identify through assessments, such as site assessments, culture and climate assessments, threat assessments, and that also help to identify and prioritize threats and hazards to be addressed in the EOP (Step 2: Understand the Situation). Related goals can be created that identify desired outcomes before, during, and after possible emergencies and then, objectives, or specific and measurable actions to achieve those goals, can be established (Step 3: Determine Goals and Objectives). Detailed courses of action are then developed to accomplish those objectives (Step 4: Plan Development [Identifying Courses of Action]). After the basic plan, its functional annexes as well its hazard- and threat-specific annexes are created collaboratively, with internal and external partners, it gets approved by all involved—see the text box above (Step 5: Plan Preparation, Review, and Approval). After sharing relevant sections of the plan with partners and stakeholders, the team conducts communication initiatives as well as training and exercise activities to help ensure everyone knows their roles and responsibilities. (Step 6: Train Stakeholders on the Plan and Their Roles).\",,,\"Office of Safe and Supportive Schools (OSSS)\nhttps://oese.ed.gov/offices/office-of-formula-grants/safe-supportive-schools/\",\"Guide for Developing High-Quality School Emergency Operations Plans\nhttps://rems.ed.gov/docs/School_Guide_508C.pdf\",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\r\nCivic Agency,\"7.\nBelonging & Civic Muscle\",OESE,ED,Office of Safe and Supportive Schools,OSSS,https://oese.ed.gov/offices/office-of-formula-grants/safe-supportive-schools/,The Role of Districts in Developing High-Quality School Emergency Operations Plans (District Guide),,https://rems.ed.gov/docs/District_Guide_508C.pdf,\"During National Preparedness Month, September 25, 2019, the agencies issued a companion guide, “The Role of Districts in Developing High-Quality School Emergency Operations Plans (District Guide). \",,,\"Office of Safe and Supportive Schools (OSSS)\nhttps://oese.ed.gov/offices/office-of-formula-grants/safe-supportive-schools/\",\"The Role of Districts in Developing High-Quality School Emergency Operations Plans (District Guide)\nhttps://rems.ed.gov/docs/District_Guide_508C.pdf\",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\r\nCivic Agency,\"7.\nBelonging & Civic Muscle\",OESE,ED,Office of Safe and Supportive Schools,OSSS,https://oese.ed.gov/offices/office-of-formula-grants/safe-supportive-schools/,REMS TA Center--School Safety Free Emergency Management Planning Tools for Education Agencies,,https://rems.ed.gov/EOPinteractivetools.aspx,\"EOP Interactive Tools, REMS TA Center.

The Center also provides services to improve the skills of LEA personnel to (1) Implement SEL EBPPs; and (2) Collect and use data to inform decision-making regarding implementation of SEL EBPPs.\n\nThe Center also coordinates with other federally funded technical assistance centers, such as the Department’s Office of Safe and Healthy Students’ (OSHS) National Technical Assistance Center for the Education of Neglected or Delinquent Children and Youth, the Department’s Office of Special Education Programs’ (OSEP) and OSHS’ Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports OSEP Technical Assistance Center, and OSEP’s Technical Assistance and Dissemination to Improve Services and Results for Children with Disabilities—Technical Assistance Center on Positive Social, Emotional, and Behavioral Outcomes for Young Children with, and at Risk for, Developmental Delays or Disabilities.\",NA,,\"Office of Safe and Supportive Schools (OSSS)\nhttps://oese.ed.gov/offices/office-of-formula-grants/safe-supportive-schools/\",\"Center to Improve Social and Emotional Learning and School Safety Grant (SEL Center)\nhttps://oese.ed.gov/offices/office-of-formula-grants/safe-supportive-schools/center-improve-social-emotional-learning-school-safety/\",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\r\nCivic Agency,\"7.\nBelonging & Civic Muscle\",OSEP,ED, Office of Special Education Programs,OSEP,https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/osers/osep/index.html,IDEAs That Work Website,,https://osepideasthatwork.org/osep-meeting/creating-safe-supportive-learning-environments-children-disabilities-2017,\"There is a growing evidence base on the relationship between positive learning environments, child development, and academic achievement. OSEP’s second Symposium highlighted core principles relating to creating and maintaining safe and supportive learning environments and why and how States, districts, programs, and schools should consider integrating this work into their improvement plans. The Symposium included examples of aligning initiatives, funds, personnel preparation, evidence-based practices, and professional development in early childhood and K-12 settings.

The centers work in the areas of civil rights, equity, and school reform. This assistance helps schools and communities ensure that equitable education opportunities are available and accessible for all children.\nTypes of Projects\nTypical activities include: (1) technical assistance in the identification and selection of appropriate education programs to meet the needs of English Learners (ELs); and (2) training designed to develop educators’ skills in specific areas, such as the dissemination of information on successful education practices and the legal requirements related to nondiscrimination on the basis of race, sex, national origin, and religion in education programs. Projects include technical assistance and training for education issues occasioned by school desegregation. The centers work with schools in the areas of harassment, bullying, and prejudice reduction. Centers also develop materials, strategies, and professional development activities to assist schools and communities in preventing and countering harassment based on ethnicity, gender, or religious background.\n\nAdditional Information\nThe purpose of this program is to award grants (cooperative agreements) to operate regional equity assistance centers to provide technical assistance and training, at the request of school boards and other responsible governmental agencies, on issues related to equity in education to ensure that all children, regardless of race, gender, national origin, or religion, have equal access to a quality education and the opportunity to develop high academic proficiency in reading, math and other core subject areas.\n\nThe Equity Assistance Centers (EACs) are a resource for the Office for Civil Rights in working with school districts that have achieved unitary status. The EACs offer technical assistance to school districts, State education agencies, and others who seek to resolve civil rights conflicts and promote social justice and equity. More recently, they provide resources and training in the areas of hate crimes, racial prejudice, and bullying.\n\nTypical activities include disseminating information on successful education practices and legal requirements related to nondiscrimination on the basis of race, sex, national origin, and religion in educational programs; training designed to develop educators’ skills in specific areas such as identification of race and sex bias in instructional materials; technical assistance in the identification and selection of appropriate educational programs to meet the needs of limited English proficient students; and instructing school officials on how to prevent sexual harassment and combat biases.\",,,\"Office of State and Grantee Relations and Evidence Based Practices (SGR)\nhttps://oese.ed.gov/offices/office-state-grantee-relations-evidence-based-practices/\",\"Equity Centers (EACs)\nhttps://oese.ed.gov/offices/office-of-formula-grants/program-and-grantee-support-services/training-and-advisory-services-equity-assistance-centers/\",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\r\nPhysical & Mental Health,\"2.\nBasic Needs for Health & Safety\",OESE,ED,Office of State and Grantee Relations and Evidence Based Practices,SGR,https://oese.ed.gov/offices/office-state-grantee-relations-evidence-based-practices/,Equity Assistance Center Region I: Center for Education Equity,,https://cee-maec.org/,\"established the Center for Education Equity (CEE) to address problems in public schools caused by segregation and inequities.

For Tiers 1-2, evidence should come from large, multisite studies with characteristics of the sample and setting1 similar to those in your school or district. Samples and settings can be pooled across multiple studies examining the same practice or program to meet the large, multisite sample criteria.
